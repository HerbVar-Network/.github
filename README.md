# About HerbVar

Welcome to the Herbivory Variability Network (“HerbVar”). We are a global research network that aims to describe and understand how and why patterns in plant–herbivore interactions vary across the tree of life and around the world. Since our founding in 2019, we have grown to more than 200 collaborators from more than 100 institutions across 30+ countries, and our dataset currently has >900 surveys of >550 plant species from 141 plant families spread across North, Central, and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Read more on our [website](https://herbvar.org/), and please email [Will Wetzel or a member of the Steering Committee](https://herbvar.org/leadership.html) if you are interested in joining us. We are always looking for additional collaborators, especially those who can contribute data from under-sampled regions or new species in our focal families. 

The Herbivory Variability Network is funded for 2022-2026 by the US National Science Foundation as a Research Coordination Network.
